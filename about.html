    <h1>Avalanche Accident Explorer</h1>

    The Avalanche Accident Explorer is a collaborative effort between the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) and Colorado Mountain College (CMC) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program. CMC GIS alumni Lucy Kepner and Joe Tayabji designed and coded the application, advised by CMC GIS professor Dara Seidl and in conjunction with staff at CAIC. The application is intended to provide CAIC staff and the public a dynamic means to visualize accident statistics and their geographical distributions according to variables of interest. These variables include travel mode, avalanche aspect, relationship to treeline, avalanche type, relative scale, destructive scale, and month/year. The application is fed by accident data collected by CAIC and served through CAIC's application programming interface (API).

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    The primary goal of this application is to promote safety in the backcountry. By equipping users to explore accident statistics in an interactive interface, we intend for users to become more familiar with avalanche geography and the potential for accidents when heading out for recreation. A second goal is to enable examination of properties associated with each accident. Users can filter accidents by date, avalanche type, travel mode, treeline, and more to view locations on the map and read accident reports. This can give a sense of, for example, where accidents take place in February where the primary travel mode is snowmobile and the site is below treeline. Another project goal is to further the development of GIS coding skills for students in the CMC GIS program with a critical real-world application. Accidents, especially fatal accidents, are sensitive data. Care has been taken to communicate these incidents respectfully. This application includes only those incidents where the report has been made public.
    
    <h2>Updates</h2>
    Over time, this application will be developed to inlcude more data, including non-fatal accidents. For this season, fatal accidents that are public will automatically be populated into the map. As part of a continuing collaboration, major updates to the map interface and charts will be coded by students in the CMC GIS program.
